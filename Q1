DALVIK VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTRUCTIONS:-
  1)ADDITION
SYNTAX- 'add'  'data type'   'result    variable',arg1,arg2
example:  add- int d0,s0,s1
   2)  MOVE
 example:move-wide/from16 vAA, vBBBB
 where
	"move" is the base opcode, indicating the base operation (move a register's value).
	"wide" is the name suffix, indicating that it operates on wide (64 bit) data.
	"from16" is the opcode suffix, indicating a variant that has a 16-bit register reference as a source.
	"vAA" is the destination register (implied by the operation; again, the rule is that destination arguments always come first), which must be in the range v0 – v255.
	"vBBBB" is the source register, which must be in the range v0 – v65535.


3)THROW
 
Example : throw vx

 example- rem- int vx,vy,vz
 Calculates vy % vz and puts the result into vx.

5)shl

Syntax: shl- data type arg1,arg2,arg3.......
example: shl-int vx, vy, vz
