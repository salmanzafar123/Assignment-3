CONTEXT AWARE COMPUTING(EXAMPLE):-

Satnav(satellite navigation) is an example of context aware routing because  of the following reason:
In a Satellite Navigation System (SatNav), the current location is the primary contextual parameter that is used to
automatically adjust the visualization (e.g. map, arrows, directions…) to the user’s current location. However, looking
at current commercial systems, much more context information is used and much of visualization has been changed.
In addition to the current GPS position, contextual parameters may include the time of day, light conditions,
the traffic situation on the calculated route or the user’s preferred places. Beyond the visualization and
whether or not to switch on the backlight, the calculated route can be influenced by context, e.g. to avoid
potentially busy streets at that time of day.
It satisfies the basic requirement of a context aware system i.e  it is aware of its environment and the context
of its use.

Another  few  examples  of context aware computing  are:  
 (a) A tablet computer switching the orientation of the screen 
 (b) Maps orienting themselves with the user’s current  location/orientation.
